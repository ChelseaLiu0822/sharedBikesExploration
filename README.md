The popularity of bicycle sharing facilitates people's mobility and plays an important role in greening the environment. By reducing the use of private cars and other motorized transport, bicycle sharing reduces fossil fuel consumption and exhaust emissions, and plays a positive role in combating climate change. Its lightweight nature also allows for a more rational use of urban space, bringing a wider range of green space and public space to the city.


In addition, bike sharing promotes energy conservation and sustainable development, provides a simple and healthy lifestyle, and enhances citizens' environmental awareness. Cycling improves physical health, subconsciously influences people's attitude towards life, and promotes a low-carbon and environmentally friendly philosophy.


Based on the above background, the data of Beijing's shared bicycle is analyzed, and the data is used to explore the current situation of shared bicycle use and user travel.
